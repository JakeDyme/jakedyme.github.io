A background service is activated when the user navigates away from the application. 
This is to ensure that the application continues to monitor for, and respond to, sounds 
even when the screen goes into sleep mode. 
The primary use-case of this application is to respond to sounds, 
whilst remaining unattended. 
This requires the application to continue as a background service. 
The service is visible in the user’s notification menu and can be monitored and controlled from the notification menu.
