    <h1>Sound-Trigger Usage Guide</h1>
    
    <h2>Summary :</h2>
    Detects sounds in the environment and allows you to respond with a chosen response.

    <h2>Suggestions for potential usage</h2>
    (note: these are only suggestions, not a description of the application's intent)
    <h2>Vibrational alert for the hard-of-hearing</h2>
    Explosions, barking dogs, yelling people, or other loud sounds in the environemnt would normally alert an individual, 
    however, someone who is hard-of-hearing may not hear these sounds. 
    This application could be used to alert a hard-of-hearing individual of activity in the environment by using the Vibration response setting.
    <h2>Snoring</h2>
    This application could be used to detect loud-snoring and respond with a sound that may disturb them enough to stop snoring.
    Set the device next to your bedside or partners bedside and adjust the sensitivity.
    <h2>Barking dogs</h2>
    The application could be used to respond to repetitive barking sounds. Adjust the tolerance settings to allow the dog to bark within reason.

    <h2>Basic Usage :</h2>
    The application will respond to sounds above a certain volume.
    You can adjust the threshold using the "Sensitivity" setting.
    There are additional settings in the Settings menu.
    </p>
    <p>
    Checking the box in the upper right hand corner of a setting,
    will add or remove the setting from the main screen.
    </p>

    <h2>Background Service :</h2>

    The background service will start automatically if you are recording...
    <li>... and you navigate away from the app.</li>
    <li>... and the phone goes to sleep.</li>
    <li>... and you close the app while recording.</li>
    <br>
    <p>On all devices the background service will start automatically, but only some devices will automatically start listening.
    On Android 10 and lower, listening will start automatically.
    On Android 11 and higher, you will have to un-pause the service by using the notification in your notifications menu.
    This is due to microphone restrictions on Android 11.
     
    </p>

    <h2>Sending Intents :</h2>
    <p>Select the response action "Send intent to other apps". 
      This response action allows you to trigger actions in other applications on your phone, such as "Macro Droid".

      and includes the following extra's:
      <li>- "MaxVol": The peak amplitude of the sound detected.</li>
